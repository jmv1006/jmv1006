Hello! My name is Jonathan Andrade Valenzuela and I am currently self-teaching myself to program with a beginning emphasis on front-end development, with aspirations to eventually become a fullstack developer.
I am currently working through The Odin Project as well Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course on Udemy.
My current focus is to build my knowledge through working on projects, big and small!
I am based in Southern California and can be reached at jonathanandradevalenzuela@gmail.com
Feel free to connect with me!
